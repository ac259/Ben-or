# Ben-Orâ€™s Randomized Consensus Algorithm
TLA+ Project - to model the Ben-Or consensus algorithm

## To Do
- [] Write the properties, this is the only way to check the algorithm.
- [] Complete the p2 phase and make sure - random - ring is also completed.
- [] TA advices to make the report detailed and explain your code well.
- [] The testing processes will be like - check properties -> test cases where it is violated -> test cases where the properties hold.
- [] Follow the Nomenclature - name your model's correctly.
